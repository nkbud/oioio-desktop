## Quick Commands

```bash
# Development
npm start                 # Start development server
npm run lint             # Check code quality
npm run health-check     # Validate build environment

# Building
npm run clean            # Clean build artifacts
npm run make             # Build for current platform
npm run make:all         # Build for all platforms

# Version Management
npm run version:patch    # Increment patch version
npm run version:minor    # Increment minor version
npm run version:major    # Increment major version

# Maintenance

```

## Release Process

### Automated (Recommended)
1. Go to GitHub Actions → "Build and Release"
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Choose version type or specify version
4. Workflow builds for all platforms and creates release

### Manual
1. Run `npm run version:patch` (or minor/major)
2. Run `npm run make:all` 
3. Create GitHub release with artifacts
