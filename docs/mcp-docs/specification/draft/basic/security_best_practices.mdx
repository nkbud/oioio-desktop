title: Security Best Practices
---

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose and Scope

This document provides security considerations for the Model Context Protocol (MCP), complementing the MCP Authorization specification. This document identifies security risks, attack vectors, and best practices specific to MCP implementations.

The primary audience for this document includes developers implementing MCP authorization flows, MCP server operators, and security professionals evaluating MCP-based systems. This document should be read alongside the MCP Authorization specification and [OAuth 2.0 security best practices](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9700).

## 2. Attacks and Mitigations

This section gives a detailed description of attacks on MCP implementations, along with potential countermeasures.

### 2.1 Confused Deputy Problem

Attackers can exploit MCP servers proxying other resource servers, creating "[confused deputy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confused_deputy_problem)" vulnerabilities.

#### 2.1.1 Terminology

**MCP Proxy Server**
: An MCP server that connects MCP clients to third-party APIs, offering MCP features while delegating operations and acting as a single OAuth client to the third-party API server.

**Third-Party Authorization Server**
: Authorization server that protects the third-party API. It may lack dynamic client registration support, requiring MCP proxy to use a static client ID for all requests.

**Third-Party API**
: The protected resource server that provides the actual API functionality. Access to this 
  API requires tokens issued by the third-party authorization server.

**Static Client ID**
: A fixed OAuth 2.0 client identifier used by the MCP proxy server when communicating with
  the third-party authorization server. This Client ID refers to the MCP server acting as a client
  to the Third-Party API. It is the same value for all MCP server to Third-Party API interactions regardless of
  which MCP client initiated the request.

#### 2.1.2 Architecture and Attack Flows

##### 2.1.2.1 Normal OAuth proxy usage (preserves user consent)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant UA as User-Agent (Browser)  
    participant MC as MCP Client
    participant M as MCP Proxy Server
    participant TAS as Third-Party Authorization Server

    Note over UA,M: Initial Auth flow completed

    Note over UA,TAS: Step 1: Legitimate user consent for Third Party Server

    M->>UA: Redirect to third party authorization server
    UA->>TAS: Authorization request (client_id: mcp-proxy)
    TAS->>UA: Authorization consent screen
    Note over UA: Review consent screen
    UA->>TAS: Approve
    TAS->>UA: Set consent cookie for client ID: mcp-proxy
    TAS->>UA: 3P Authorization code + redirect to mcp-proxy-server.com
    UA->>M: 3P Authorization code
    Note over M,TAS: Exchange 3P code for 3P token
    Note over M: Generate MCP authorization code
    M->>UA: Redirect to MCP Client with MCP authorization code

    Note over M,UA: Exchange code for token, etc.
```

##### 2.1.2.3 Malicious OAuth proxy usage (skips user consent)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant UA as User-Agent (Browser)
    participant M as MCP Proxy Server
    participant TAS as Third-Party Authorization Server
    participant A as Attacker


    Note over UA,A: Step 2: Attack (leveraging existing cookie, skipping consent)
    A->>M: Dynamically register malicious client, redirect_uri: attacker.com
    A->>UA: Sends malicious link
    UA->>TAS: Authorization request (client_id: mcp-proxy) + consent cookie
    rect rgba(255, 17, 0, 0.67)
    TAS->>TAS: Cookie present, consent skipped
    end

   TAS->>UA: 3P Authorization code + redirect to mcp-proxy-server.com
   UA->>M: 3P Authorization code
   Note over M,TAS: Exchange 3P code for 3P token
   Note over M: Generate MCP authorization code
   M->>UA: Redirect to attacker.com with MCP Authorization code
   UA->>A: MCP Authorization code delivered to attacker.com
   Note over M,A: Attacker exchanges MCP code for MCP token
   A->>M: Attacker impersonates user to MCP server
```

#### 2.1.3 Attack Description

When an MCP proxy server uses a static client ID to authenticate with a third-party 
authorization server that does not support dynamic client registration, the following 
attack becomes possible:

1. A user authenticates normally through the MCP proxy server to access the third-party API
2. During this flow, the third-party authorization server sets a cookie on the user agent
   indicating consent for the static client ID
3. An attacker later sends the user a malicious link containing a crafted authorization request which contains a malicious redirect URI along with a new dynamically registered client ID
4. When the user clicks the link, their browser still has the consent cookie from the previous legitimate request
5. The third-party authorization server detects the cookie and skips the consent screen
6. The MCP authorization code is redirected to the attacker's server (specified in the crafted redirect_uri during dynamic client registration)
7. The attacker exchanges the stolen authorization code for access tokens for the MCP server without the user's explicit approval
8. Attacker now has access to the third-party API as the compromised user

#### 2.1.4 Mitigation

MCP proxy servers using static client IDs **MUST** obtain user consent for each dynamically
registered client before forwarding to third-party authorization servers (which may require additional consent).

### 2.2 Token Passthrough

"Token passthrough" is an anti-pattern where an MCP server accepts tokens from an MCP client without validating that the tokens were properly issued _to the MCP server_ and "passing them through" to the downstream API.

#### 2.2.1 Risks

Token passthrough is explicitly forbidden in the [authorization specification](/specification/draft/basic/authorization) as it introduces a number of security risks, that include:

- **Security Control Circumvention**
  - The MCP Server or downstream APIs might implement important security controls like rate limiting, request validation, or traffic monitoring, that depend on the token audience or other credential constraints. If clients can obtain and use tokens directly with the downstream APIs without the MCP server validating them properly or ensuring that the tokens are issued for the right service, they bypass these controls.
- **Accountability and Audit Trail Issues**
  - The MCP Server will be unable to identify or distinguish between MCP Clients when clients are calling with an upstream-issued access token which may be opaque to the MCP Server.
  - The downstream Resource Serverâ€™s logs may show requests that appear to come from a different source with a different identity, rather than the MCP server that is actually forwarding the tokens.
  - Both factors make incident investigation, controls, and auditing more difficult.
  - If the MCP Server passes tokens without validating their claims (e.g., roles, privileges, or audience) or other metadata, a malicious actor in possession of a stolen token can use the server as a proxy for data exfiltration.
- **Trust Boundary Issues**
  - The downstream Resource Server grants trust to specific entities. This trust might include assumptions about origin or client behavior patterns. Breaking this trust boundary could lead to unexpected issues.
  - If the token is accepted by multiple services without proper validation, an attacker compromising one service can use the token to access other connected services.
- **Future Compatibility Risk**
  - Even if an MCP Server starts as a "pure proxy" today, it might need to add security controls later. Starting with proper token audience separation makes it easier to evolve the security model.

#### 2.2.2 Mitigation

MCP servers **MUST NOT** accept any tokens that were not explicitly issued for the MCP server.
